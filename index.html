					<h2>ABOUT</h2>
					<!-- about you -->
					<p>I excel as a quick learner and love working in collaborative settings where I can contribute actively to team projects and embrace new technologies. My academic journey has equipped me with a strong grasp of both front-end and back-end technologies. I'm skilled in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks like React, enabling me to design responsive and visually appealing user interfaces. One standout project of mine was a weather application where I seamlessly integrated front-end and back-end elements, showcasing my ability to retrieve real-time data and create intuitive UI experiences.</p>
